# david-the-game
David saves you from your brother in a roblox game, then proceeds to nuke everyone in the area (ingame) causing you to kill him (ingame). This leads to him ending up in the hospital and in a coma, and you have to pay for his medical bills (this is not ingame oh). You learn why he is in the hospital at the end of the game.

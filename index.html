        David saves you from your brother in a roblox game, then proceeds to nuke everyone in the area (ingame) causing you to kill him (ingame).
        This leads to him ending up in the hospital and in a coma, and you have to pay for his medical bills (this is not ingame oh).
        <br><br>
        you are now REQUIRED to help him, so do it :D
